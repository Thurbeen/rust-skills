# Negotiation Response Templates

> Standard templates for agent negotiation responses.

## Agent Response Template

When `negotiation: true`, agents MUST use this format:

```markdown
## Negotiation Response

### Findings

[Query results - what was discovered]

### Confidence

- **Level**: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | UNCERTAIN
- **Reason**: [Why this confidence level]

### Gaps Identified

- [ ] [Gap 1: What couldn't be found or verified]
- [ ] [Gap 2: Incomplete information area]
- [x] [Gap 3: Initially missing but resolved] (if applicable)

### Context Needed

- Q1: [Clarifying question for orchestrator]
- Q2: [Scope/constraint question]

### Metadata

- **Source**: [Where data came from]
- **Coverage**: [Query coverage, e.g., "80% - missing X"]
```

## Orchestrator Evaluation Template

When evaluating agent responses:

```markdown
## Evaluation: [Agent] Response

### Intent Mapping

- Original question aspect 1: [COVERED|PARTIAL|MISSING]
- Original question aspect 2: [COVERED|PARTIAL|MISSING]

### Confidence Assessment

- Agent reported: [LEVEL]
- Adjusted assessment: [LEVEL] (if different)
- Reason: [why adjustment]

### Gap Impact

| Gap | Impact on Intent | Action |
|-----|------------------|--------|
| [Gap 1] | [HIGH | MEDIUM |
| [Gap 2] | [HIGH | MEDIUM |

### Context Provision

[Answers to agent's context questions]

- A1: [answer to Q1]
- A2: [answer to Q2]

### Decision

- [ ] ACCEPT - Proceed to synthesis
- [ ] REFINE - Query again with context
- [ ] ALTERNATIVE - Try different agent
- [ ] ESCALATE - Need user input
```
